        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Coffee beans are a gift. They are the foundation of our café's culture, an evolution of tastiness, give us
          opportunity
          to display our genuine master crafting of hot beverage.
          To brew is an artform, nearly comparable to zen meditation, without haste, the grinding fills the presence -
          there is no goal in the turning of the handle but creating small waves of delicate scent.
          Some say: there is no perfection, only excellence by striving forever. The lowtech basics are key:
          mechanically ground beans, a french press and patience are our recipe.
        </p>

        <p>No sugar, real milk. While detoxing from sugar addiction it became clear to our barista team that milk all by
          itself is sweet enough for our taste!</p>

        <h2>The Supreme Cookie</h2>
        <p>Once there was only ship's rusk. Dry, bland and hard as rock. After centuries of crumbling distasteful
          blandness...
          oversea traders brought the solution. Sugar from sugar canes. Cacao from cacao beans. We added the flour of
          our golden wheat fields.
          Mixing it all together, we fuel it with rum to get the dough perfect and then let it bake in our stone stove.
          Hand crafted goodness, melting on the tongue!
        </p>

        <p>Our other competitor for best cookie of all times this side of the galaxy is the non-chocolate lemon variant.
          When you suffer from triple-choc-overload come
          and relax your tase buds with fruity freshness and crumbly bits.

        <h2>Loose Tea</h2>
        <p>Perfect timing delivers the correct brewing temperatures.</p>

        <p>Cooling is key. Tea is something that should be approached with patience. And we are always careful at what
          heat level the brewing process
          is allowed to commence. For example there is our green tea selection, best when the water is down to
          seventy-five degree celsius,
          that is 167 degree Fahrenheit, brewed for a short time it keeps you awake for way longer than coffee could.
          And for relaxation
          the green tea leaves can be left for another four to five minutes which makes the theine dissolve differently
          thus
          creating a desireable relaxing effect.
